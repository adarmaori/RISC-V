# RISC-V

This is a personal project I'm doing, mostly to learn about processor architecture in general and specifically the RISC-V architecture. I hope to make this implementation better than my previous attemps in terms of performance, code readability, size on FPGA and more. 
By the end of this project I hope to have a RISC-V core with efficient pipelining and other optimizations, that will be customizable enogh to turn it into ome piece of a larger, multi-core processor in the future. This is still very much in the idea face, but that is the idea.
